"Navigation Center brought in lots of drug sales. They set up shop across the street. ABC News just did a puff piece on it and said it’s gotten better. Not so. "

"It mostly warm and Sunny, clean, modern, and the most conveniently located out of all SF neighborhoods (close the to FD, the Bay Bridge, and highways 101 and 280, even Costco is a 5 min drive; and if you’re a Giant’s fan, it’s paradise : )"
